# default-latex-headers

This repository contains a lightweight set of packages and definitions that will
be used as the default headers in latex projects built using the `package create manuscript`
command in `scikit-package`.

On typing that command, this repository will be temporarily cloned to your local computer
and the latex files in `default_latex_headers` will be read and the information loaded
into the manuscript file in the new project.
